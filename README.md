  <h1> RF-Clown </h1>
  <p> A fully open-source BLE and Bluetooth jammer </p>
  ## :star2: About the Project
RF-Clown is an open-source BLE and Bluetooth jammer inspired by similar projects in the community. Unlike many closed-source implementations, RF-Clown emphasizes transparency and education. The project is meant for testing and learning about RF technologies and communication protocols.  

**Why RF-Clown?**  
1. Promote open-source collaboration in RF research.  
2. Encourage exploration of RF vulnerabilities.

<!-- Features -->
### ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Dual NRF24L01 Configuration**: Utilizes both HSPI and VSPI on the ESP32 for simultaneous BLE and Bluetooth operations.  
- **Mode Switching**: Easily toggle between BLE, Bluetooth, or combined jamming modes using a single button.  
- **NeoPixel Feedback**: LED indicates the current mode (BLE, Bluetooth, or combined).  
- **Portable Design**: Powered by a lithium battery with a TP4056 charger for convenience.  
- **Custom PCB**: Includes an onboard CP2102 for programming, LF33 voltage regulator, and other essential components.  
- **Open-Source Code**: Freely available for exploration and modification.

## ðŸ”— Uploading the Firmware (.bin) to ESP32

If you prefer not to upload the code manually or encounter errors during compilation, you can directly upload the precompiled `.bin` file to the ESP32. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download the Required Tools
1. **ESP32 Flash Download Tool**: Download the tool from Espressif's official site: [ESP32 Flash Download Tool](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/tools/flash_download_tool_3.9.7_2.zip).
2. **USB Drivers**: Make sure the drivers for the ESP32 are installed on your system. You can download the drivers from [CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) if you're using the CP2102 chip.

### Step 2: Prepare the `.bin` File
1. Download the precompiled `.bin` file from the repository. 

### Step 3: Upload the `.bin` File to ESP32
1. Connect your ESP32 to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Open the **ESP32 Flash Download Tool** and configure the following:
   - Select the appropriate **chip type** (ESP32) and click **OK**.
   - In the **Download Path Config** section, add the `.bin` file and set the start address to `0x1000`.
   - Select the correct **COM port** where your ESP32 is connected.
   - Choose the correct **Baud rate** (115200 is generally recommended).

3. Click on **Start** to begin uploading the `.bin` file to your ESP32.

### Step 4: Verify the Upload
Once the upload is completed, the tool will confirm a successful flash. You can now restart your ESP32 and run the firmware.

&nbsp;
### Arduino IDE Settings:
If you want to upload the sketch code to the ESP32, use the following settings in the Tools menu:
- Built using ESP32 Board Version 1.0.5
