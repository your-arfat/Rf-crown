      <h1>üîß Introduction</h1>
      <p>In a world where wireless communication surrounds us, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Classic Bluetooth are critical components for countless devices. From smartwatches to wireless headphones, these technologies form the backbone of modern connectivity. However, understanding their vulnerabilities and limitations is essential for researchers and enthusiasts alike. Enter RF-Clown, an open-source BLE jammer designed for education and research purposes.
      </br> </br>
The motivation behind RF-Clown was to create a tool that could serve as an example of open-source collaboration. Many similar projects remain closed, limiting their use to a select few. With RF-Clown, all resources‚Äîfrom code to PCB designs‚Äîare freely available on GitHub, ensuring transparency and accessibility.
</br> </br>
This blog post will guide you through the RF-Clown project, detailing its features, design, and implementation. Additionally, we‚Äôll discuss how to build it using a breadboard and explore its potential applications.</p>

    <!-- üìú Writing the Code -->
    <div class="code sections">
      <h1>üìú Writing the Code</h1>
      <p>The heart of RF-Clown lies in its firmware. The code is structured to allow seamless switching between BLE, Classic Bluetooth, and combined modes. Here‚Äôs an overview of the key functions: <br/> <br/>
      <h3>Mode Switching</h3>
      <br/> <br/>
      <p>RF-Clown uses a button connected to GPIO 33 to switch between modes. A NeoPixel LED provides visual feedback:
</br>
‚Ä¢ <b>Blue:</b> BLE mode.</br>
‚Ä¢ <b>Green:</b> Classic Bluetooth mode.</br>
‚Ä¢ <b>Red:</b> Combined mode.</p>
 <br/> <br/>
<h3>SPI Configuration</h3>
 <br/> <br/>
<p>The ESP32‚Äôs VSPI and HSPI interfaces control two NRF24L01 modules simultaneously. This setup allows efficient hopping across multiple frequencies.</p>

<img src="images/c1.png" alt="void configureRadio(RF24 &amp;radio, int channel, SPIClass *spi) {
    if (radio.begin(spi)) {
        radio.setAutoAck(false);
        radio.stopListening();
        radio.setPALevel(RF24_PA_MAX, true);
        radio.startConstCarrier(RF24_PA_HIGH, channel);
    }
}
"> <br/>



<h3>Jamming Functions</h3>
<br/> <br/>
<p>Each mode employs different channel sets to disrupt communication:
<br/>
‚Ä¢ <b>BLE Channels:t</b> 2, 26, 80 <br/>
‚Ä¢ <b>Classic Bluetooth Channels:</b> 32, 34, 46, 48, 50, 52, etc.</p>
<img src="images/c2.png" alt="void jamBLE() {
    int randomIndex = random(0, sizeof(ble_channels) / sizeof(ble_channels[0]));
    radioVSPI.setChannel(ble_channels[randomIndex]);
}

      <p>A custom PCB was designed to make RF-Clown portable and robust. The PCB integrates all components, including the ESP32, NRF24L01 modules, NeoPixel LED, and power management circuitry.
      <br/> <br/>
      <h3>Key Features of the PCB</h3> <br/> <br/>
      <p>‚Ä¢ Compact layout for portability.<br/>
‚Ä¢ Dedicated headers for NRF24L01 modules. <br/>
